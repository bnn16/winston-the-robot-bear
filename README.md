# Winston - Your Personal AI Assistant

> "Not only CEOs deserve personal assistants."

Remember the first time you saw Tony Stark talking to Jarvis? That moment when technology felt truly magical? **Winston** brings that vision to life - an AI assistant that actually knows you, manages your life, and gets smarter over time.

## 🎯 The Vision

Winston isn't just another voice assistant that sets timers. It's your personal AI companion that:
- **Remembers** your conversations and learns your patterns
- **Thinks ahead** to help before you even ask
- **Integrates** with your digital life seamlessly
- **Talks** to you naturally - no chat interfaces needed

### Real-Life Examples

**Morning Rush:**
> You: "I'm running late!"
> Winston: "I'll message your team that you'll be 10 minutes late. Your first meeting isn't until 10, so you're fine. Oh, and you got an important email from your boss about the Johnson project - want me to read it to you while you drive?"

**Evening Commute:**
> You: "What's in my fridge?"
> Winston: "Not much - just eggs and some vegetables. Want me to find a grocery store on your route? I can make a list based on what you might want to cook."

**Student Life:**
> You: "I have an exam in 5 days and I'm freaking out."
> Winston: "Okay, let's break this down. Based on your syllabus, you need to cover 8 chapters. I'll create a study schedule - 2 chapters per day with breaks. Want me to quiz you each evening on what you studied?"

## 🚀 Features (Planned for MVP)

- **Smart Memory**: Maintains context across all conversations
- **Email Management**: Summarizes, prioritizes, and helps you respond
- **Calendar Intelligence**: Preps you for meetings, manages your schedule
- **Proactive Reminders**: Thinks ahead so you don't have to
- **Voice-First Interface**: Everything happens naturally through conversation

Currently building with:
- **Backend**: Python (FastAPI)
- **AI**: LLM integration (GPT-4/Claude/Llama)
- **Memory**: Vector database for conversation history
